## Nov. 5: **#vomitlipo** -- In your text, the order of consonant phonemes in each word must follow the [place of articulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_phonology); start with phonemes articulated at the back of the mouth, end with phonemes articulated at the front. For instance, "good" starts at the velum and ends at the alveolar ridge. You can follow the [table in this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_phonology#Consonants) from right to left.

We all know a word with beginning with a W and ending with an F.
